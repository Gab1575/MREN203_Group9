SMORES is proposing HERSHEY; a fully autonomous rover capable of completing this task. HER-
SHEY will be capable of navigating itself to the Three Forks Junction from any nearby Mars
landing site and will automatically retrieve samples using camera based object detection and a
fork-lift mechanism for sample collection and storage. While HERSHEY is designed for fully au-
tonomous operation, it will incorporate robust Human Machine Interface (HMI) features to allow
for monitoring and manual takeover if necessary.
