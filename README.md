SMORES is proposing HERSHEY; a fully autonomous rover capable of completing this task. HERSHEY will be capable of navigating itself to the Three Forks Junction from any nearby Mars landing site and will automatically retrieve samples using camera based object detection and a fork-lift mechanism for sample collection and storage. While HERSHEY is designed for fully autonomous operation, it will incorporate robust Human Machine Interface (HMI) features to allow for monitoring and manual takeover if necessary.
